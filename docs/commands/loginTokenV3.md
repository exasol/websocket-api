### loginToken: Establishes a connection to Exasol using an OpenID token

This command invokes the login process which establishes a connection
between the client and Exasol. As long as the connection is open,
the user can interact with Exasol using the commands specified
below.

:warning: This command requires a TLS connection (i.e., `wss://...`).

The login process is composed of four steps:

1. The client sends the `loginToken` command including the requested protocol 
   version.
   
   Request fields:
     * command (string) => command name: "loginToken"
     * protocolVersion (number) => requested WebSocket protocol version, (e.g., 3)
   
   Request JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "command": "loginToken",
        "protocolVersion": <number>
    }
   ```

2. The server responds with either
     * "ok", in which case the login process continues in step 3, or
     * "error", in which case the login process is aborted.

   Response fields:
     * status (string) => command status: "ok" or "error"
     * exception (object, optional) => only present if status is "error"
       * text (string) => exception message which provides error details
       * sqlCode (string) => five-character exception code if known, otherwise "00000"
   
   Response JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "status": <"ok" | "error">,
        // if status is "error"
        "exception": {
                "text": <string>,
                "sqlCode": <string>
        }
    }
   ```
   
   
3. The client sends either an OpenID `accessToken` or a `refreshToken` and optionally
   other client information.
   
   Request fields:
     * accessToken (string, optional) => OpenID access token to use for the login process
     * refreshToken (string, optional) => OpenID refresh token to use for the login process
     * useCompression (boolean) => use compression for messages during the session (beginning after the login process is completed)
     * sessionId (number, optional) => requested session ID
     * clientName (string, optional) => client program name, (e.g., "EXAplus")
     * driverName (string, optional) => driver name, (e.g., "EXA Python")
     * clientOs (string, optional) => name and version of the client operating system
     * clientOsUsername (string, optional) => client's operating system user name
     * clientLanguage (string, optional) => language setting of the client system
     * clientVersion (string, optional) => client version number
     * clientRuntime (string, optional) => name and version of the client runtime
     * attributes (object, optional) => array of attributes to set for the connection (see below)
   
   Request JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "accessToken": <string>,
        "refreshToken": <string>,
        "useCompression": <boolean>,
        "sessionId": <number>,
        "clientName": <string>,
        "driverName": <string>,
        "clientOs": <string>,
        "clientOsUsername": <string>,
        "clientLanguage": <string>,
        "clientVersion": <string>,
        "clientRuntime": <string>,
        "attributes": {
                // as defined separately
        }
    }
   ```
   
   
4. The server uses either `accessToken` or `refreshToken` (see 3.) to authenticate the
   user. If successful, the server replies with an "ok" response and a
   connection is established. If authentication of the user fails, the
   server sends an "error" response to the client indicating that the login
   process failed and a connection could not be established.
   
   Response fields:
     * status (string) => command status: "ok" or "error"
     * responseData (object, optional) => only present if status is "ok"
       * sessionId (number) => current session ID
       * protocolVersion (number) => WebSocket protocol version of the connection (e.g., 1)
       * releaseVersion (string) => Exasol version (e.g. "6.0.0")
       * databaseName (string) => database name (e.g., "productionDB1")
       * productName (string) => Exasol product name: "EXASolution"
       * maxDataMessageSize (number) => maximum size of a data message in bytes
       * maxIdentifierLength (number) => maximum length of identifiers
       * maxVarcharLength (number) =>  maximum length of VARCHAR values
       * identifierQuoteString (string) => value of the identifier quote string (e.g., "'")
       * timeZone (string) => name of the session time zone
       * timeZoneBehavior (string) => value of the session option "TIME_ZONE_BEHAVIOR"
     * exception (object, optional) =>  only present if status is "error"
       * text (string) => exception message which provides error details
       * sqlCode (string) => five-character exception code if known, otherwise "00000"
   
   Response JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "status": <"ok" | "error">,
        // if status is "ok"
        "responseData": {
                "sessionId": <number>,
                "protocolVersion": <number>,
                "releaseVersion": <string>,
                "databaseName": <string>,
                "productName": <string>,
                "maxDataMessageSize": <number>,
                "maxIdentifierLength": <number>,

                "timeZone": <string>,
                "timeZoneBehavior": <string>
        },
        // if status is "error"
        "exception": {
                "text": <string>,
