### login: Establishes a connection to Exasol

This command invokes the login process which establishes a connection
between the client and Exasol. As long as the connection is open,
the user can interact with Exasol using the commands specified
below.

The login process is composed of four steps:

1. The client sends the `login` command including the requested protocol 
   version.
   
   Request fields:
     * command (string) => command name: "login"
     * protocolVersion (number) => requested WebSocket protocol version, (e.g., 1)
   
   Request JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "command": "login",
        "protocolVersion": <number>
    }
   ```

2. The server returns a public key which is used to encode the
   user's password. The public key can be obtained in one of two ways:
    a. importing the key using the `publicKeyPem` field
    b. constructing the key using the `publicKeyModulus` and `publicKeyExponent` fields

   Response fields:
     * status (string) => command status: "ok" or "error"
     * responseData (object, optional) => only present if status is "ok"
       * publicKeyPem (string) => PEM-formatted, 1024-bit RSA public key used to encode the user's password (see 3.)
       * publicKeyModulus (string) => hexadecimal modulus of the 1024-bit RSA public key used to encode the user's password (see 3.)
       * publicKeyExponent (string) => hexadecimal exponent of the 1024-bit RSA public key used to encode the user's password (see 3.)
     * exception (object, optional) => only present if status is "error"
       * text (string) => exception message which provides error details
       * sqlCode (string) => five-character exception code if known, otherwise "00000"
   
   Response JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "status": <"ok" | "error">,
        // if status is "ok"
        "responseData": {
                "publicKeyPem": <string>,
                "publicKeyModulus": <string>,
                "publicKeyExponent": <string>
    },
        // if status is "error"
        "exception": {
                "text": <string>,
                "sqlCode": <string>
        }
    }
   ```
   
   
3. The client sends the username, encrypted password, and optionally
   other client information.
   
   Request fields:
     * username (string) => Exasol user name to use for the login process
     * password (string) => user's password, which is encrypted using publicKey (see 2.) and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, encoded in Base64 format
     * useCompression (boolean) => use compression for messages during the session (beginning after the login process is completed)
     * sessionId (number, optional) => requested session ID
     * clientName (string, optional) => client program name, (e.g., "EXAplus")
     * driverName (string, optional) => driver name, (e.g., "EXA Python")
     * clientOs (string, optional) => name and version of the client operating system
     * clientOsUsername (string, optional) => client's operating system user name
     * clientLanguage (string, optional) => language setting of the client system
     * clientVersion (string, optional) => client version number
     * clientRuntime (string, optional) => name and version of the client runtime
     * attributes (object, optional) => array of attributes to set for the connection (see below)
   
   Request JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "username": <string>,
        "password": <string>,
        "useCompression": <boolean>,
        "sessionId": <number>,
        "clientName": <string>,
        "driverName": <string>,
        "clientOs": <string>,
        "clientOsUsername": <string>,
        "clientLanguage": <string>,
        "clientVersion": <string>,
        "clientRuntime": <string>,
        "attributes": {
                // as defined separately
        }
    }
   ```
   
   
4. The server uses `username` and `password` (see 3.) to authenticate the
   user. If successful, the server replies with an "ok" response and a
   connection is established. If authentication of the user fails, the
   server sends an "error" response to the client indicating that the login
   process failed and a connection could not be established.
   
   Response fields:
     * status (string) => command status: "ok" or "error"
     * responseData (object, optional) => only present if status is "ok"
       * sessionId (number) => current session ID
       * protocolVersion (number) => WebSocket protocol version of the connection (e.g., 1)
       * releaseVersion (string) => Exasol version (e.g. "6.0.0")
       * databaseName (string) => database name (e.g., "productionDB1")
       * productName (string) => Exasol product name: "EXASolution"
       * maxDataMessageSize (number) => maximum size of a data message in bytes
       * maxIdentifierLength (number) => maximum length of identifiers
       * maxVarcharLength (number) =>  maximum length of VARCHAR values
       * identifierQuoteString (string) => value of the identifier quote string (e.g., "'")
       * timeZone (string) => name of the session time zone
       * timeZoneBehavior (string) => value of the session option "TIME_ZONE_BEHAVIOR"
     * exception (object, optional) =>  only present if status is "error"
       * text (string) => exception message which provides error details
       * sqlCode (string) => five-character exception code if known, otherwise "00000"
   
   Response JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "status": <"ok" | "error">,
        // if status is "ok"
        "responseData": {
                "sessionId": <number>,
                "protocolVersion": <number>,
                "releaseVersion": <string>,
                "databaseName": <string>,
                "productName": <string>,
                "maxDataMessageSize": <number>,

                "timeZoneBehavior": <string>
        },
