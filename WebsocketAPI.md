# EXASOL JSON over WebSockets API - Introduction

## Why a WebSockets API?

The JSON over WebSockets client-server protocol allows customers to 
implement their own drivers for all kinds of platforms using a 
connection-based web protocol. 

The main advantages are flexibility regarding the programming languages 
you want to integrate EXASOL into, and a more native access compared to 
the standardized ways of communicating with a database, such as JDBC, 
ODBC or ADO.NET, which are mostly old and static standards and create
additional complexity due to the necessary driver managers.


## Clients support

Currently a native Python driver using this WebSocket API has been
implemented. By that you don't need any pyodbc bridge anymore, but 
can connect your Python directly with EXASOL. PyODBC is not ideal due
to the need for an ODBC driver manager and certain restrictions in 
data type conversions.

Further languages will be added in the future, and we encourage you
to provide us feedback what languages you are interested in, and 
maybe you are even keen to support our community with own developments. 
It would then be nice if you could share your work with us, and 
we will of course help you by any means. 


# EXASOL JSON over WebSockets API details

## WebSocket Protocol v1

WebSocket Protocol v1 requires an EXASOL client/server protocol of
at least v14. It follows the standards IETF as RFC 6455.

The connection server identifies the initial GET request by the client.
This request contains information about the used protocol version.
Depending on this information the matching login and protocol class is
chosen.

After the handshake the process is identical to a connection using the
standard drivers like JDBC or ODBC: The connection server listens to
incoming messages and forwards the requests to the database. 


### Login: Establishes a connection to EXASOL

This command invokes the login process which establishes a connection
between the client and EXASOL. As long as the connection is open,
the user can interact with EXASOL using the commands specified
below.

The login process is composed of four steps:

1. The client sends the login command including the requested protocol 
   version.
   
   Request fields:
     * command (string) => command name: "login"
     * protocolVersion (number) => requested WebSocket protocol version, (e.g., 1)
   
   Request JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "command": "login",
        "protocolVersion": <number>
    }
   ```

2. The server returns a public key which is used to encode the
   user's password. The public key can be obtained in one of two ways:
    a. importing the key using the publicKeyPem field
    b. constructing the key using the publicKeyModulus and publicKeyExponent fields

   Response fields:
     * status (string) => command status: "ok" or "error"
     * responseData (object, optional) => only present if status is "ok"
       * publicKeyPem (string) => PEM-formatted, 1024-bit RSA public key used to encode the user's password (see 3.)
       * publicKeyModulus (string) => hexadecimal modulus of the 1024-bit RSA public key used to encode the user's password (see 3.)
       * publicKeyExponent (string) => hexadecimal exponent of the 1024-bit RSA public key used to encode the user's password (see 3.)
     * exception (object, optional) => only present if status is "error"
       * text (string) => exception message which provides error details
       * sqlCode (string) => five-character exception code if known, otherwise "00000"
   
   Response JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "status": <"ok" | "error">,
        // if status is "ok"
        "responseData": {
                "publicKeyPem": <string>,
                "publicKeyModulus": <string>,
                "publicKeyExponent": <string>
    },
        // if status is "error"
        "exception": {
                "text": <string>,
                "sqlCode": <string>
        }
    }
   ```
   
   
3. The client sends the username, encrypted password, and optionally
   other client information.
   
   Request fields:
     * username (string) => EXASOL user name to use for the login process
     * password (string) => user's password, which is encrypted using publicKey (see 2.) and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, encoded in Base64 format
     * useCompression (boolean) => use compression for messages during the session (beginning after the login process is completed)
     * sessionId (number, optional) => requested session ID
     * clientName (string, optional) => client program name, (e.g., "EXAplus")
     * driverName (string, optional) => driver name, (e.g., "EXA Python")
     * clientOs (string, optional) => name and version of the client operating system
     * clientOsUsername (string, optional) => client's operating system user name
     * clientLanguage (string, optional) => language setting of the client system
     * clientVersion (string, optional) => client version number
     * clientRuntime (string, optional) => name and version of the client runtime
     * attributes (object, optional) => array of attributes to set for the connection (see below)
   
   Request JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "username": <string>,
        "password": <string>,
        "useCompression": <boolean>,

                // as defined separately
        }
    }
   ```
   
   
4. The server uses username and password (see 3.) to authenticate the
   user. If successful, the server replies with an "ok" response and a
   connection is established. If authentication of the user fails, the
   server sends an "error" response to the client indicating that the login
   process failed and a connection couldn't be established.
   
   Response fields:
     * status (string) => command status: "ok" or "error"
     * responseData (object, optional) => only present if status is "ok"

     * exception (object, optional) =>  only present if status is "error"
       * text (string) => exception message which provides error details
       * sqlCode (string) => five-character exception code if known, otherwise "00000"
   
   Response JSON format
   ```javascript
    {
        "status": <"ok" | "error">,
        // if status is "ok"
        "responseData": {
                "sessionId": <number>,
                "protocolVersion": <number>,
                "releaseVersion": <string>,
                "databaseName": <string>,

    }
   ```
   

3. The client sends the username, encrypted password, and token.

   Request fields:
     * username (string) => EXASOL user name to use for the login process
     * password (string) => user's password, which is encrypted using publicKey (see 2.) and PKCS #1 v1.5 padding, encoded in Base64 format

        "token": <number>
    }
   ```
   
4. The server uses username, password, and token (see 3.) to
   authenticate the user. If successful, the server replies with an
   "ok" response and a subconnection is established. If authentication of
   the user fails, the server sends an "error" response to the client
   indicating that the login process failed and a subconnection couldn't
   be established.

This command executes a prepared statement which has already been
created.

If the SQL statement returns a result set which has less than 1,000 rows of data, the data will be provided in the data field of resultSet. However if the SQL statement returns a result set which has 1,000 or more rows of data, a result set will be opened whose handle is returned in the resultSetHandle field of resultSet. Using this handle, the data from the result set can be retrieved using the Fetch command. Once the result set is no longer needed, it should be closed using the CloseResultSet command.

Request fields:
  * command (string) => command name: "executePreparedStatement"
  * attributes (object, optional) =>   attributes to set for the connection (see below)
  * statementHandle (number) => prepared statement handle
  * numColumns (number) => number of columns in data

## Data Types

### Data Types: Type names and properties

The following data types and properties can be used to specify column
types in the executePreparedStatement request.

| Type | Required Properties | Optional Properties |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BOOLEAN | |
| CHAR | size | |
| DATE | | |
| DECIMAL | precision, scale | |
| DOUBLE | | |
| GEOMETRY | | |
| INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND | precision, fraction | |
| INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH | precision | |
| TIMESTAMP | | withLocalTimeZone |
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | | withLocalTimeZone |
| VARCHAR | size | |


The following data types and properties are used to specify column
types in responses from EXASOL.

| Type | Properties |
| --- | --- |
| BOOLEAN | |
| CHAR | size, characterSet |
| DATE | size |
| DECIMAL | precision, scale |
| DOUBLE | |
| GEOMETRY | size, srid |
| INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND | size, precision, fraction |
| INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH | size, precision |
| TIMESTAMP | size, withLocalTimeZone |
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | size, withLocalTimeZone |
| VARCHAR | size, characterSet |

## Compression

The data in the WebSocket data frames may be compressed using zlib. In
order to enable compression, the client must set the useCompression
field in the login command to true. If compression is enabled during
login, all messages sent and received after login completion must be
binary data frames, in which the payload data (i.e., command
request/response) is zlib-compressed.


## Heartbeat/Feedback Messages

The feedbackInterval session attribute specifies how often (in seconds)
unidirectional heartbeat/feedback messages are sent to the client
during query execution. These messages are sent using Pong WebSocket
control frames (see RFC 6455), and thus a response is not expected.

The client may send Ping WebSocket control frames (see RFC 6455) to
EXASOL, for example, as client-initiated keepalives. EXASOL
will respond to a Ping frame with a Pong response.

EXASOL will not send Ping frames to the client.

## Subconnections

### Introduction

Subconnections are additional connections to EXASOL cluster nodes which can be created by the client. The main reason to create and use subconnections, as opposed to simply using the existing main connection, is to parallelize fetching/inserting data from/into EXASOL.

For example, fetching a result set from EXASOL can be done easily using the main connection. In this scenario, the EXASOL cluster nodes will automatically send their data to the node which is connected to the client. This node then sends the combined data as a single result set. Thus, the client does not need to be aware of any data sharing/communication among the EXASOL cluster nodes.

However, for performance-critical scenarios, a significant performance gain can be acheived by using subconnections to fetch/insert data directly from/into multiple EXASOL cluster nodes in parallel. Thus, instead of all the data going through the single main connection, the data can flow through multiple subconnections to different EXASOL nodes in parallel.

Please note that subconnections are only useful for multi-node EXASOL clusters. With a single-node EXASOL instance, the subconnection would basically be a duplicate of the main connection.

### How to create and use subconnections

Subconnections are created using the enterParallel command. The number of requested subconnections can be specified by the user, and the number of subconnections actually opened is given in the enterParallel response. Please note that the maximum number of subconnections is equal to the number of nodes in the EXASOL cluster. For example, if the user has an eight-node cluster and requests 1,000 subconnections, only eight subconnections will be opened. As a general rule, the number of subconnections should usually be equal to the number of nodes in the EXASOL cluster, which ensures one subconnection per node. After the subconnections have been created, the subLogin command should be used to login to each subconnection. Note: Failing to login to all subconnections will cause the login to hang. After this, they are ready for use.

:warning: Any command can be executed on subconnections; however, there is a significant difference in *how* they can be executed. The only two commands which can be executed ansynchronously on subconnections (i.e., not executed on all subconnections at the same time) are fetch and executePrepared. All other commands are synchronous, meaning the same command must be executed on all subconnections at the same time. For example, if the execute command is not called on all subconnections, the call will hang and eventually fail because of a time out.

After a subconnection is no longer needed, the disconnect command should be called and the WebSocket for it closed as normal. Please note that subconnections can be reused for multiple statements.

### Example

The following is an example of how to create, use, and close subconnections to fetch a result set from an executed prepared statement. If subconnections have already been created or are needed afterwards, the enterParallel, subLogin, and disconnect commands may be ignored.

1. On main connection:
   * Create subconnections (enterParallel)

2. On subconnections:
   * Login to subconnection (subLogin)

3. On main connection:
   * Execute prepared statement (executePreparedStatement)

4. On subconnections:
   * Get result set offset (getOffset)
   * Fetch result set data using the offset (fetch)
   * Close result set (closeResultSet)
   * Disconnect (disconnect)

5. On main connection:
   * Close result set (closeResultSet)
